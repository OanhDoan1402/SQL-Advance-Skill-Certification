-- **TOPIC: WINNER CHARTS**

-- There were a number of contests where participants each made multiple attempts.  The attempt with the highest score is the only one considered.  
-- Write a query to list the contestants ranked in the top 3 for each contest.  If multiple contestants have the same score in a contest, they are at the same rank.
-- Report event_id, rank 1 name(s), rank 2 name(s), rank 3 name(s).  Order the contests by event_id. Names that share a rank should be ordered alphabetically and 
-- separated by a comma.
-- Order the report by event_id.
